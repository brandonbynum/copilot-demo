<!-- # React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list -->

### Github Copilot

**What is copilot?**

-   ai paired programmer that uses code context to suggest code at each individual line
-   ability to provide suggestions based on context from comments and existing code.
-   available as an extension for various IDEs, including Neovim, VS Code, Visual Studio, and JetBrains IDEs.

**Key Features:**

1. **Instant Suggestions:** Copilot suggests individual lines and entire functions instantly, facilitating faster coding.
2. **Handling Low-level Tasks:** Common coding tasks like scaffolding new code, building APIs, and working with regular expressions.
3. **Adaptability:** Copilot adapts to the programmer's personal style over time, making it more intuitive to use.
4. **Language Compatibility:** Works with all major programming languages, enabling developers to work across different projects seamlessly.

**Benefits:**

-   **Enhanced Productivity:** By reducing time spent on boilerplate code and repetitive patterns, Copilot allows developers to focus more on building quality software.
-   **Staying in Flow:** Helps programmers stay in the flow by providing suggestions, new paths, and ideas quickly, reducing interruptions during the coding process.
-   **Learning Support:** Can assist in learning new programming languages by providing contextually relevant suggestions and guidance.

**Cons:**

-   Does not always provide the correct solution
-   Does not always correctly interpret code

**Conclusion:**

GitHub Copilot serves as a powerful tool in the toolbox of the modern-day developer, offering both assistance and potential learning opportunities. However, while it excels in automating repetitive tasks, it is currently not a replacement for a full understanding of code logic and design.
